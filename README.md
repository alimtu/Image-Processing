This project utilizes the YOLOv9 model to accurately detect and classify military objects, such as tanks, drones, and warships, in complex visual environments. The model is trained using a large dataset of military imagery to achieve high precision and real-time object recognition. It demonstrates the power of deep learning in enhancing security and surveillance capabilities in military applications.
